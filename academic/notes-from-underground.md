###Reflections on Dostoyevsky's *Notes From Undergound*

The narrator, the Underground Man, is right to suppose that there is a more universal meaning to his story. The Underground Man’s notes should not be interpreted as merely the ravings of an isolated, idiosyncratic *underground dweller*. 

>[Y]ou may be angry with me for saying this, you will cry out against me and stamp your foot: ‘You are talking only about yourself and your underground miseries, don’t dare speak of ‘all of us!’ Excuse me gentlemen, I am not trying to excuse myself with that *allness*. As for what concerns me personally, after all I have only carried to a logical conclusion in my life what you yourselves didn’t dare take more than half-way; and you supposed your cowardice was common sense, and comforted yourselves with self-deception (p. 122-123).

Although the Underground man is alienating himself in his speech, pushing the reader away, perhaps reflecting mans alienation from the world. Dostoyevsky’s *Notes From Underground* reflect his thoughts concerning the human condition, what it is creating. “[W]e all show off with our diseases, and I, perhaps, more than anyone. Don’t let’s argue; I express myself clumsily. But all the same I’m firmly convinced that not only a great deal, but every kind, of intellectual activity is a disease” (p. 18). Dostoyevsky focuses on ‘real’ people, generally city dwellers, prostitutes. The Underground Man is critical of rational egoism and totalitarian visions of utopia. The Underground Man is a victim of the modern experience. 

>Not only couldn't I make myself malevolent, I couldn’t make myself anything: neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect. Now I go on living in my corner and irritating myself with the spiteful and worthless consolation that a wise man can’t seriously make himself anything, only a fool makes himself anything. Yes, a man of the 19th century ought, indeed is morally bound, to be essentially without character; a man of character, a man who acts, is essentially limited (p. 16).

Deprived of positive social interactions, the Underground Man tries to relate to the world according to the codes and examples he finds in European literature. The failure of these attempts makes him even more bitter and isolated, driving him deeper underground.
